//AIM:Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded
//constructor initializes employee details.The default constructor should Initialize
//name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the
//name and sets a default salary.  Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to
//display employee information.



// Employee.java
public class Employee {

    // Instance variables
    String name;
    double salary;

    // Default constructor
    public Employee() {
        name = "Unknown";
        salary = 0;
    }

    // Overloaded constructor to initialize name with a default salary
    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = 50000; // default salary if only name is given
    }

    // Method to display employee details
    public void DisplayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: " + salary);
    }

    // Main method to test the Employee class
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an employee with the default constructor
        Employee employee1 = new Employee();
        employee1.DisplayEmployeeDetails();

        // Creating an employee with a custom name and default salary
        Employee employee2 = new Employee("John Doe");
        employee2.DisplayEmployeeDetails();
    }
}

//OUTPUT: Listening on 51989
//User program running
//Employee Name: Unknown
//Employee Salary: 0.0
//Employee Name: John Doe
//Employee Salary: 50000.0
//User program finished
